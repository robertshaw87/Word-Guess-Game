// check user input to make sure it is a new guess

// add the letter to the already guessed array

// if it is a letter within the correct word array,
// replace the correct placeholder characters in the guess array 
//  with the letter guessed

// if the guess array is completed and equal to the word array,
// add 1 to wins, reset guesses, already guessed array,

// add guess to already guessed array, reduce guesses left

// if there are no guesses left, increment losses, reset game
